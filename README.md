## Project overview

You can checkout the live project [here](https://taxinod.com).

Imagine you arrive in a city like Yaounde where taxis are usually shared [Taxi au Cameroun (Wikipedia)](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxi_au_Cameroun) and you don't know what it costs. Before going somewhere in taxi, you might want to know how much you should pay. Taxinod was created just for that. It tells you how much you should pay to go from one taxi stop to another one. You just need to select your origin and destination from the app and it will show you the route(s) between those stops and their prices. The route(s) are also displayed on the map.
